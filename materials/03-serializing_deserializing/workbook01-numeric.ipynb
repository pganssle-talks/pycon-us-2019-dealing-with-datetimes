    "### Absolute vs. civil times\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important concept with regards to serializing and deserializing datetimes is keeping in mind the distinction between *absolute times* (timestamps) and *civil times* (datetimes or wall times). These two concepts are often overloaded in common parlance, but they have very different properties with respect to serialization and deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Absolute times** represent a specific point in time, where the time on the wall does not matter. For events in the past, such as timestamps on logs, you *usually* care about the absolute time (either for purposes of ordering or for purposes of calculating elapsed time).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of when you may want an absolute time*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transactions and logs\n",
    "- Timing a biological process (e.g. feeding a fish)\n",
    "- Timing an chemical or astronomical process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Civil times** represent a specific time *as defined by the clock on the wall*. If, for example, you have a meeting at noon every Friday but your time zone shifts by 1 hour, you would not start holding the meeting at 11 AM because that 168 hours after the previous meeting. For events in the future you *usually* care about civil times.\n",

    "While you, as a human, are probably used to consuming your datetimes as some sort of string, like \"October 21, 2015\" or \"2015-10-21\", when dealing with *absolute* datetimes, the most natural representation is probably as an offset from some reference time, e.g. 17 hours after this process started or 250,000 seconds after the Unix epoch.\n",
